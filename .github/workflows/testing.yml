  # We use the following hack: define the concurrency group as 'workflow run ID'
  # + 'workflow run attempt' because it is a unique combination for any run. So
  # it effectively discards grouping.
  #
  # XXX: we cannot use `github.sha` as a unique identifier because pushing a tag
  # may cancel a run that works on a branch push event.
